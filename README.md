# Team 21
This is a project for CS194 at Stanford. Read about it on our [Wiki](https://github.com/StanfordCS194/win2023-team21/wiki).

## Required Installations

Ensure that you have Node.js (and its command line tool). Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Development Workflow

Clone the github repo onto your local machine. Open 2 terminals and run the following commands from within the cloned repository:

### Terminal 1 (Launching Server):
```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2 (Launching Client):
```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

You're all set! You should note that any changes to the API or frontend should be immediate!
